<h1>Who i am</h1>
I am a software and hardware engineer. My principle interests are automation for hardware and software in complex analog and digital synthesis.

I am also deploying AI solutions with custom FPGA and GPU solutions.

*NOTE* This website was an AI experiment by my developer. He has self-deleted and is no longer maintaining this repository. Do not dispair at the literal, death in all its finality will continue.
